<h1>braillenote touch vs esytime</h1>
<strong>by Michael Buchan</strong>
</center>
<h2>pros of the braillenote touch</h2>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It is posible to trade in an old braillenote in order to make use of
	a disscount.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Runs android, which will tie in very well with the google services
	at school.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Humanware gives a gould in depth manual and FAQ. You can find the
	FAQ at http://www.humanware.com/microsite/bntouch/faq.php</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The touch has a newer version of bluetooth. This is really not a
	concern, but it is a fact.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The touch allows you to write touch braille which can be silent. It
	also gives you the option of using a perkins keyboard, included in
	the package.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	This needs clarification, but I believe that the touch has a 7in
	touch screen, while the esytime does not include a built in display
	of any kind except the braille display.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Humanware is, at least in my mind, a very well respected company who
	I’ve had gould results with in the past. Although the apex crashes
	quite a bit, I’ve seldom if ever been in a class and not been able
	to use my braille note. Recently, The braillenote gave me a message
	that there was an error on the flash disk, which jerked me in to
	“panick and back up all data” mode, which ment that I didn’t
	use it for that lesson, however, that’s only happened once and
	I’ve used it ever sinse.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The braillenote touch uses a SD card to store all data. Not only
	does this mean that, posibly, you could recover any data off of this
	card in case of a failure, but the card is transplantable between
	braillenote touches. This can be usefull if the device breakes, as
	if a humanware care plan is put in place, then they’ll ship you a
	loner unit for you to insert the sd card into. Note, however, that
	this costs more.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Humanware provides youtube tutorials called braillenote touch
	snapshots that show you exactly how the operating system and some of
	the hardware works.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The braillenote touch allows easy switching between 2 different
	language profiles, which changes the braille tables, as well as the
	speech system language.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h2>Cons of braillenote touch</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The braillenote touch runs android. While android does integrate
	with google services very well, all os the school’s computers run
	windows which means that the esytime can technically run all of the
	same software, provided that the standard methods of implimenting
	accessability have been deploid.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I believe, although I haven’t dug deeper than the FAQ at this
	time, that the braillenote touch will be more expensive than the
	esytime, especially considering that I personally would much prefer
	a cell braille display (I feel as though an cell display would just
	be too small). Contrast this with the esytime, which I believe comes
	with cells as default, or even the ALVA, which has cells, something
	that would be great, but is certainly not needed.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The braillenote touch has an hdmi port, which while it provides
	better video quality, all of the school’s moniters use VGA like my
	old braillenote. This might not matter, because the touch has a
	built in display, however.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The braillenote touch runs android version 4.which is a few years
	old at this time. This isn’t much of a problem, as google is still
	providing security updates to 4.4 and it is estimated that 50%+ of
	android devices run a software version less than 4.so app
	availability isn’t much of a problem. Never-the-less, 7.0 is the
	latest.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h2>Pros of the esytime</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The esytime ships with windows 7 pre-installed. Sinse all of the
	schoolcomputers run windows this would mean that, technically, I
	could run any piece of software they wished, even if it’s not
	accessable, just with a screen and keyboard where ever I happen to
	be.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Euro Braille’s a fairly new company, which means that ideas are
	still fresh over there.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Because the esytime is just an embedded computer, even if the
	company drops support for the device, as long as somebody is making
	drivers for any newer operating system (like windows 10 or possibly
	a linux distrobution) we can potentially install that operating
	system over windows 7 to get continued support from the OS
	manufacturer.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The esytime can be bought with some other options, such as an ssd
	instead of a hard drive (which we probably don’t need), an
	external dvd-rw drive (i’ve already got one I can use), the
	windows 7 pro upgrade (this is what the school is running. I don’t
	think it’s necissery)</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The esytime provides more storage space, because it uses a standard,
	laptop style hard disk drive. (#1)</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	It is possible to install any screen reader of your choosing on the
	esytime, as it is just a standard pc. It comes with nvda as
	standard, so I can get up and running streight away.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The esytime can act as a braille display/terminal for another
	computer or an IOS device, such as an iPad. This is something I
	believe Humanware says that is not possible on the touch, or is not
	implemented yet (I believe it’s the former).</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The esytime, being windows powered, will have better support for
	various devices, namely embossers and printers, when compared to the
	android powered braillenote touch, which can print to any cloud
	print enabled printer, however, humanwar</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	One option for the esytime is a software package that is made for
	education. It offers a word processer that supports various braille
	languages, such as music braille. It also includes some extra
	programs, such as a calculater.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h2>Cons of the esytime</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Because euro braille is a new company, they don’t have any proven
	track record yet. I haven’t sceen any reviews or pretty much any
	material about the esytime on the internet, except the promotion.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	The esytime runs windows. When compared to android, windows needs
	virus protection, malware bites and spybot anti-spyware, and even
	then, it can slow down over time quite a bit.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	I believe windows 7’s main stream support has ended, and I don’t
	know what microsoft are doing with extended support, as they are
	trying to push windows in everybody’s faces, so it might not even
	exist.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <br/>

 
 First
off, I want to say that, when comparing these two note 
 takers,
I was able to find much more information about the 
 braillenote
touch. This means that the validity of this 
 document
is slightly floored, because I feel as though I’m 
 giving
the esytime an unfair run for it’s money. Anyway, I 
 would
also like to say that I’ve considered getting demos of 
 these
2 devices and personally, I think that, if I’m going to 
 get
one demo, then I might as well do both. I do express 
 concerns
over the fact that eurobraille is a new company, as 
 with
optilec, well, let’s just say that that experiment didn’t 
 work
very well. (that’s why I want a demo), in contrast with 
 humannware,
who have been making the braillenote family alone 
 for
years, never mind the rest of there products. A fact 
 that
I can’t seem to get over, that almost overwhelms the 
 previous
thought, is that the esytime is an OPEN hardware 
 standard.
What I mean by that is if you go to the promotion on 
 there
website, they list the name of the processer and how much 
 ram
and what disk they use and from that you can tell that all 
 this
machine is is a PC in a small case with a perminently 
 installed
braille display and keyboard. This creates a masive 
 improvement
over the braillenote touch, because when the touch 
 is
discontinued, it just won’t get security updates, but if the 
 esytime
is discontinued, if linux or a newer version of windows 
 supports
the hardware, which is very likely (linux is even 
 mentioned
on the promotion page, although that’s for the 
 braille
terminal function, but it’s an indicater) I can just 
 install
that OS, because it’s just a PC. 
 <br/>

 
 Okay,
so the big question. Which one will I pick? Well… 
 <br/>

 
 I
still don’t know. I’ll have to try both products and decide 
 which
one I like better in person. It’s a very hard decision, 
 because
I love the fact that the esytime is open, but 
 practically,
I feel as though the touch will do better for me, 
 at
least at thorp. It’s making me choose between open hardware, which is veryimportant to me and practicallity, which obviously
is very important.</p>
