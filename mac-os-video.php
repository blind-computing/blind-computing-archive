<h2>Mac OS X Accessibility</h2>
<p>  Apple is one of the most influential companies of our time, love it or hate it. For me, mac os was the solution to my windows screen reader issues and I believe I made the right decision, at least until I found linux. So how accessible is mac OS 10.12 exactly? Let\'s find out</p>
<p>here\'s a quick video showing the accessibility features of Mac OS 10.12.</p>

<p>  After the success of my part 1 video and at long last, the second video in this series is finally here. There really isn\'t many videos about this topic on youtube, so I\'m at it again with a video about mac OS 10 (sorry, not the 10 bit any more, apple doesn\'t want that). This video is recorded using version 10.12 of the mac OS, so anything added after then is not covered. I also didn\'t go into much depth about different features, mainly focusing on voiceover so that people who are coming to the mac can grasp how it works. Enjoy!</p>
