<h1>Blind Computing is Currently Undergoing Major Changes</h1>
<p>Currently, I'm working on completely redoing the site <strong>for the second time</strong> to make it much more robust and easier to manage. Much help is needed to get this done faster, so if you can, please <a href="https://github.com/mcb2003/blind-computing" title="opens the github page">help us rewrite the site in PHP with mysql</a>. If not, don't worry. The site will be  back soon and you can <a href="http://bit.ly/2oTj1ZW" title="opens the blind computing blog RSS feed">subscribe to the blog with your favourite rss news reader</a> to get alerted when the website's back. You can also check back at this page.</p>
<p>If you would like to visit the incomplete, work-in-progress site, you can <a href="home.php" title="navigates to the still-in-developement version of the site">do so by clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
