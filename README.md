## What Is Blind Computing?

This website is the hub of content for blind and visually impaired users that use a computer. We will cover as much as we can, from blind/vi devices, to the latest operating systems, down to accessible tools, programs and web sites that contributers have found useful.

## How to Access the Site

## Why all the ReWrites?

  I know, I know. I litterally just rewrote the entire site in bAash, but come on, it's bash! Of course I wasn't going to stick with it.

    Now, before you start smashing yoyur keyboard unnecessarily, bash is a good language. But with what I want to do, it's a major pain in the 
    but. I couldn't even use apache freaking 2 to host the pages and had to resort to httpd from busybox, all because of bash!

      So, I'm screwing this whole thing and moving back to php, except this time it's going to be implemented correctly.
