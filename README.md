# blind-computing
A website devoted to exposing facts and information about computing in the blind/vi world

## What Is Blind Computing?

This website is the hub of content for blind and visually impaired users that use a computer. We will cover as much as we can, from blind/vi devices, to the latest operating systems, down to accessible tools, programs and web sites that contributers have found useful.

## How to Access the Site

You can visit the blind computing website by [clicking here](https://blindcomputing.org).
  You can also get a sneak preview into what the site will be in the future by visiting the __beta__ version of the site at [this link](https://beta.blindcomputing.org).

## How to Contribute

  If you're a programmer, you're allready in the right place. Currently, the site uses the _master_ branch to get its files,  as the php-rewrite is now complete. If I decide to rewrite in the future (and if that ever happens, it'll be __long__ in the future) this will change.

### List of Branches

Branch | Description
------ | -----------
master | _currently_ the main branch of the project. It holds the new, rewritten version of the site.
mysql-file | contains an __sql dump__ of the database. I try to keep this up-to-date, but it doesn't always happen, so if you find something on the site that's not in the .sql file, please __let me know by opening an issue or via [email](mailto:mikeybuchan@hotmail.co.uk)__.
nginx-conf | contains __most__ of the nginx configuration files used to run the site.
old-version | Holds the extremely old PHP version of the site before the first rewrite. This is a __protected branch__ and should _not_ be tampered with.
rewrite-2018-01-9 | The old __bash based__ version of the site. This is also a protected branch that should _not_ be messed with.

__note:__ any other branches are topic branches. Their names should convey what they are, but if not,, _feel free to look at the changes_. If there are any stale branches not mentioned above, please contact me to remind me to remove them.
