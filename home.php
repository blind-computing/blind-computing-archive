        <h2>What is Blind Computing?</h2>
        <p>This website is the hub of content for blind and visually impaired users that use a computer. We will cover as much as we can, from blind/vi devices, to the latest operating systems, down to accessible tools, programs and web sites that contributors have found useful.</p>
        <p>  Blind computing was started out of the demise of braillenoteusers.info, a site that I used a lot and found very helpfull. It aims to reconstruct the library of braillenote content on that site, however, we plan to cover a much broader scope of topics that are not necessarily related to the braille note.</p>
        <h2>how to contribute</h2>

        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>We recommend you view this site in mozilla firefox, found at <a href="https://firefox.com/download">the firefox download page</a>, if you're on a computer. Other browsers might work, but in general, firefox is more accessible anyway.</p>
