        <h2>We're Undergoing a Rewrite!</h2>
        <p>Currently, I'm working on completely redoing the site <strong>for the second time</strong> to make it much more robust and easier to manage. Much help is needed to get this done faster, so if you can, please <a href="https://github.com/mcb2003/blind-computing" title="opens the github page">help us rewrite the site in PHP with mysql</a>. If not, don't worry. The site will be finished soon and you can <a href="http://bit.ly/2oTj1ZW" title="opens the blind computing blog RSS feed">subscribe to the blog with your favourite rss news reader</a> to get alerted when it's ready. You can also check back at this page.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading</p>

        <h2>What is Blind Computing?</h2>
        <p>This website is the hub of content for blind and visually impaired users that use a computer. We will cover as much as we can, from blind/vi devices, to the latest operating systems, down to accessible tools, programs and web sites that contributers have found useful.</p>
        <p>  Blind computing was started out of the demise of braillenoteusers.info, a site that I used a lot and found very helpfull. It aims to reconstruct the library of braillenote content on that site, however, we plan to cover a much broader scope of topics that are not necessarily related to the braille note.</p>
        <h2>how to contribute</h2>
        <p>Please see the <a href="/contributing.php">contributing page</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>We recommend you view this site in mozilla firefox, found at <a href="https://firefox.com/download">the firefox download page</a>, if you're on a computer. Other browsers might work, but in general, firefox is more accessible anyway.</p>
