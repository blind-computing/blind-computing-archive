<h2>What is blind computing</h2>
<p>  In early September 2016, 13 year old Michael C Buchan was getting quite frustrated. There simply was not any up to date, useful content on the internet about blind devices, software and other accessible computer related things. So, he created blind computing.</p>
<p>Blind computing is made to be the hub of content for blind and visually impared users that need or want to use a computer. We will try to cover as much as we can, from blind/vi devices, to the latest computer operating systems, all the way down to accessible tools, programs and web sites that contributers have found useful.</p>
