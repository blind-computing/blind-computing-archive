<h2>What is blind computing</h2>
<p>Blind computing is made to be the hub of content for blind and visually impared users that need or want to use a computer. We will try to cover as much as we can, from blind/vi devices, to the latest computer operating systems, all the way down to accessible tools, programs and web sites that contributers have found useful.</p>
<p>  Blind computing was actually started out of the demise of braillenoteusers.info, which is a site that the creater of this web site used a lot and found very helpfull. It aims to reconstruct the library allready existing on that website, however, we plan to cover a much broader scope of topics that are not related to the braille note.</p>
