<h2>The Blind Computing Blog</h2>
<p>  This website has always been about uncovering up-to-date information on the general accessibility of technology, be it linux, mac os (wether it\	\'s legacy or current) and windows (from 1.01 to windows 10). It\'s main goal is to show people how to do things, or review things so that people know what they\'re bying. While this is all well and good, it poses the question, "Where should we get the information in the first place?" Because of this, I\'ve decided to start a blind-computing blog, which will create a place where I and other contributers can pose questions to the community, provide updates on what we\'re working on,etc, without clogging up the main web site.</p>
<p>  This new blog will be hosted by google using it\'s blogger service, which unfortunately means that while accessible, will be very slow and laborious to load and navigate with accessible software. To help get around this problem, I advise any person who wishes to read this to subscribe to the RSS/ATOM feed, which will greately improve the accessibility if a good feed reader is used.</p>
